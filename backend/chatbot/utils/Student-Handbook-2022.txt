 HAVING A BLAST IN UP CEBU  
 
Getting admitted to the University of the Philippines 
is by itself already a big  achievement. It means besting 
thousands of other aspirants from all over the country and 
forming the top 25% of the Philippine high school 
graduate population who are able to qualify for a UP 
education. The process of education however is quite 
another thing.  It calls for grit and stamina not only of the 
physical kind, but of the intellectual and psychological as 
well, to weather and survive the special educational 
culture of the University. This culture revolves around a 
set of academic rules and regulations, which every  well-
meaning student needs to be concerned about.

1.25 Excellent  
1.50 Very Good  
1.75 Very Good  
2.0 Good  
2.25 Good  
2.50 Satisfactory  
2.75 Satisfactory  
3.0 Passed  
4.0 Conditional Failure  
5.0 Failed  
INC Incomplete  
 
Only these grades shall be officially recognized.  
 
A grade of 4.0 may be made up by repetition of the course or by passing a re -examination to 
be taken within one academic year from the date of the grade of 4.0 has been received. If a 
student passes the re - examination, he/she is given a grade of 3.0, but if he/she fails he/she 
is given a grade of 5.0. Only one (1) re -examination is allowed which must be taken within the 
prescribed time. If a student does not remove the grade of 4.0 within the prescribed time, h e 
may earn credit for the course only by repeating and passing it.  
A grade of 4.0 given for the first semester work of a two -semester course shall be converted 
to a grade of 3.0 if the student passes the second semester part of the same course in the 
same academic year. If he/she fails, the grade of 4.0 that he/she received for the first semester 
work shall be converted to a grade of 5.0.  
The grade INC is given if the student whose class standing throughout the semester is passing 
but fails to appear for th e final examination or fails to complete other requirements of the 
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  15 
 course due to illness or other valid reasons. In case the class standing is not passing and the 
student fails to take the final examination for any reason, a grade of 5.0 is given. Removal of 
the INC must be done within the prescribed time by passing an examination or meeting all 
requirements of the course, after which the student shall be given a final grade based on 
overall performance.  
 
14. Removal of Grades of Incomplete or 4.0  
Examinations for the removal of grades of INCOMPLETE or 4.0 may be taken without fee: 1) 
during the regular examination period, if the subject in which a student failed to take his/her 
final examination is included in the schedule of examination for the pe riod during which said 
removal examination is to be taken; otherwise, said student is to be charged the fee of P20.00; 
2) during the removal examination period,  viz. the period covering ten (10) days preceding 
the registration in each semester; provided, that the examination for the particular subject is 
taken at the time that is scheduled; 3) within the ten -day  period preceding the Christmas 
vacation in colleges in which there is no inter - semester vacation; provided the examination is 
taken at the time it is scheduled.  
The period for the removal of grades of INCOMPLETE should not exceed beyond one (1) 
academic year from the date the grade was received.  
 
15. Scholastic Delinquency  
 
a. Warning  
Any student who gets a final grade below 3.0 in 25% to 49% of the total  
number of academic units at the end of the semester for which he/she is 
registered will be placed on a warning status. He/she shall be de - loaded three 
(3) units out of the total regular load for the succeeding semester.  
 
    b.  Probation  
At the end of the semester, any student who obtains final grades below 3.0 in 
50% to 74% of the total number of academic units enrolled shall be placed on 
probation in the succeeding semester with a de - loading of six (6) academic 
units.  
Probatio n may be removed by passing with grades of 3.0 or better in more 
than 50% of the units in which he has final grades in the succeeding semester.  
 
 
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  16 
            c. Dismissal  
Any student who, at the end of the semester, obtains final grades of below 3.0 
in more than 75% but less than 100% of the total number of academic units in 
which he/she received final grades  shall be  dropped from the rolls of the 
college . 
Any student on probation who again fails in 50% or more of the total number 
of units in which he/sh e received final grades  shall be  dropped from the rolls 
of the college . 
 
    d. Permanent Disqualification

in 100% of the academic units in which he/she is given final grades  shall be 
permanently barred from re -admission  to any college or school of the 
University.  
Permanent disqualification does not apply to cases where, on 
recommendation of the instructors concerned, the faculty certifies that the 
grades of 5.0 were due to the student’s unauthorized dropping subjects and 
not to poor scholarship. However, if the unauthorized withdrawal takes place 
after the mid -semester and the student’s class standing is poor, his/her grades 
of 5.0 shall be counted against him/her for  the purpose of the scholarship rule.  
 
16. HONORIFIC SCHOLARSHIP  
 
Honorific scholarship does not entitle the holders to any tuition fee waiver, either partial 
or full.  
 
a. UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIP  
 
Any undergraduate student who obtains at the end of the semester a weighted

UP Cebu Student Handbook  17 
 In addition  to the general weighted average (GWA) prescribed, a student must have 
taken during the previous semester at least 15 units of academic credits or the normal 
load prescribed (in the case of graduate students not less than 9 units); must be up to 
date with all the non - academic requirements (P.E. and NSTP) . 
 
17.  Maximum Residence Rule  
A student must finish the requirement of a course of any college within a period of actual 
residence equivalent to 1 1/2 times the normal length prescribed for the course (6 years), 
otherwise he/she shall not be allowed to register further in the college.

academic and other requirements prescribed for graduati on. 
All candidates for graduation must have their deficiencies made up and their records 
cleared not later than  five weeks before  the end of their last semester except for those

No stude nt shall be graduated from the University unless he/she has completed  at least 
one year of residence work  that may, however, be extended to a longer period by the 
proper faculty. The residence work referred to must be done immediately prior to 
graduation.  
No student who fails to pay the required graduation fee within the specified period set by 
the College Secretary shall be conferred any title or degree. Such a student may,

IV. STUDENT  RIGHTS  AND  OBLIGATIONS  
 
The notion that a student’s place in an institution of higher learning is but to study has 
long been rejected in the University of the Philippines. It has been replaced with an 
entirely different tradition the by -word of which is militancy. The tradition revolves around 
the idea that thought should transcend the classroom and transform itself into action.  
 
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  29 
 Because of its affinity with the high purpose of national welfare, student militancy is 
appraised as a cherished value not only in the academe but in the entire Filipino society. 
As such, it is to be defended and preserved.  
 
The pursuit of this tradition of militancy is moored in certain basic rights guaranteed to 
students.

c. Participation in the governance of the institution.  
The student’s right of freedom of inquiry includes the right not only to accurate 
information, but also to hear any opinion on any subject of public or general concern.  
 
For this purpose, they may have the right to invite outside speakers, and school 
authorities may not veto their invitation solely on the basis of the credentials of the 
speakers.  
 
It also includes the right not to be subjected to indoctrination leading to impo sed 
ideological homogeneity.  
 
The student’s freedom of expression includes the right:  
 
a. To hold any kind of peaceful demonstration.  
 
b. To protest against school policies and national or local policies 
even though not related to the school.  
 
c. To circulate literature and petitions for signature.  
 
 
The student’s rights to fair play in disciplinary proceedings include the following rights:  
 
a. Not to be punished for acts that were not grounds for disciplinary  action 
when they were committed.  
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  30 
  
b. To a writt en notice of the charges and reasonable time to answer them 
and prepare for their hearing.  
 
c. To a hearing before suspension or expulsion, unless summary 
suspension is clearly authorized in limited cases.  
 
d. To an impartial judge.  
 
e. To be assisted by a counsel.  
 
f. To confront and question adverse witnesses.

3. General Guidelines To Address Students Involved In Red -Tagging Incidents  
 
I. WHAT IS RED -TAGGING?  
Red-tagging is the malicious labelling o f individuals or organizations critical of the 
Government. It involves associating an individual or group with forces that warrant 
security actions from the State. It implies a security threat even in the absence of proof 
to support the threat. Malicious l abelling can happen online and be demonstrated on 
public platforms to send the message that an individual or group is associated with a 
security threat. Red -tagging leads to harassment by State forces and the general public. 
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  41 
 It violates the presumption of innocence of individuals and organizations and can deprive 
them of the opportunity to be tried before the court. Red -tagging  is  inimical  to  the  
Philippine  Constitution,  particularly  the  Bill  of  Rights,  and  to  the commitments of 
the University  under Republic Act No. 9500 or the "University of the Philippines Charter 
of 2008,"which states, among others, that the "National University is committed to serve 
the Filipino nation and humanity. While it carries out the obligation to pursue universal 
principles, it must relate its activities to the needs of the Filipino people and their 
aspirations for social progress and transformation. The National University may provide 
venues for student volunteerism."  
II. RED -TAGGING AS A CRISIS SITUATION  
Red-Tagging puts a Student in distress because malicious labelling can lead to events 
with serious implications  on students'  security, peers,  and  family  members.  The  
incident  can  invite  dangerous attention on students' speech and movement and can  
lead to harassment of their family members and peers close to the said Student. A 
Student, for the purpose of this Guidelines, and as adopted from the 2012 Code of 
Student Conduct of UP Diliman, along with the related provisions of the University Code, 
is any individual admitted to and registered in a degree or non -degree program, cross -
registered in any course of the University on a regular or part -time basis, including one 
who is officially on leave of absence; and who has not yet been  separated from  t he 
University Formally  through  either  transfer,  graduation,  honorable  or dishonorable 
dismissal, expulsion or expiration of the period allowed for maximumresidence.123 June 
2021  version. The Initial version of the Guidelines was prepared by the UP S ystem Sub -
Committee on Students -in-Distress on 21 May 2021. The initial version was reviewed to 
the UP System Crisis Management Committee and the UP Office of the Vice President 
for Legal Affairs on 21 May 2021 and 10 June 2021, respectively.

 General Guidelines To Respond To Suicide -Related Communications  
From UP Students  
1.  WHAT ARE SUICIDE -RELATED COMMUNICATIONS?  
 For the purpose of this Guidelines, Suicide -related Communications (SRCs) are acts 
and/or messages about a person’s intent to co mmit suicide or suicide experience that 
are conveyed publicly. The act or message presented by the individual may include a 
self-destructive desire, a self -injurious gesture, or an attempt that would cause serious 
harm or death on the subject. SRCs can app ear online and be demonstrated on public 
platforms to send the message that an individual plans to commit suicide, or is 
entertaining thoughts that may unintentionally lead to death or injuries.  
SRCs are potential indicators of Suicide. Suicides are self -directed acts and behaviors 
with the intent to inflict severe harm or death on the person. Suicides include self -inflicted 
behavior that resulted in death, near - fatal self -injurious behavior, and similar self -harm 
attempts. When the evaluation of an SRD le ads to the identification of a potential Suicide, 
actions may be undertaken to respond to such cases. These actions shall be guided by 
the General Guidelines to Respond to Suicide Incidents.  
2.  SRC AS A CRISIS SITUATION  
 SRCs are viewed as public messagin g when conveyed through the media and similar 
public platforms (e.g., social networking sites, newsletters, websites, public service 
announcements). The impact of these SRCs are intensified due to its increased 
coverage and its message being relatable to o ther students.  
A SRC from a UP student, or an individual claiming to be a UP student can lead to a 
crisis situation in the University because (1) it can indicate an attempt to cause serious 
harm or death to the person, and/or (2) influence vulnerable indiv iduals to imitate the 
behavior.  
    For this Guidelines, the subject of the Suicide Incident shall refer to a UP student or 
an individual claiming to be a UP student. A UP student is:  
Any individual admitted/registered, in a degree or non -degree program, c ross-registered 
in any course of the University on a regular or part -time basis, including one who is 
officially on leave of absence  
Any individual who has not yet been separated from the UP formally through either 
transfer, graduation, honorable or dishonorable dismissal, expulsion, or expiration of the 
period allowed for maximum residence.

 4. UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES (UP) PRIVACY NOTICE FOR STUDENTS  
(REVISED AS OF THE 1st SEMESTER/TRIMESTER 2019 -2020) POLICY  
To exercise and safeguard academic freedom and uphold your right to quality education, 
the University of the Philippines needs to process your personal and sensitive personal 
information - that is, information that identifies you as an individual.  
UP is committed to comply with the Philippine Data Privacy Act of 2012 (DPA) in order 
to protect your right to data privacy.  
This notice explains in general terms the purpose and legal basis for the processing of 
the typical or usual examples of personal and sensitive personal information that UP 
collects from students like you, the measures in place to protect your data privacy and 
the rights that you may exercise in relation to such information.  Please note that this 
document does not contain an exhaustive list of all of UP's processing systems as well 
as the purpose and legal basis for processing.  
Under the DPA, personal information may be processed (e.g. collected, used, stored, 
disclosed, etc. ) with the consent of the data subject, pursuant to a contract with the data 
subject; when it is necessary in order for UP to comply with a legal obligation; to protect 
your vitally important interests including life and health; respond to a national emerg ency, 
public order, and safety; fulfill the functions of public authority or pursuant to the 
legitimate interests of the University or a third party; except where such interests are 
overridden by your fundamental rights.  
Sensitive personal information (e.g . confidential educational records, age/birthdate, civil 
status, health, religious affiliation etc.) on the other hand may be processed with the 
consent of the data subject, when such is allowed by laws and regulations, such 
regulatory enactments provide f or the protection of such information, and the consent of 
the data subject is not required for such law or regulation. For example, under the 
Education Act of 1982, parents have the right to access the educational records of 
children who are under their pa rental responsibility. Processing may also be done when 
needed to protect the life and health of the data subject or another person, and the data 
subject is unable to legally or physically express consent; in the case of medical 
treatment; or needed for th e protection of lawful rights and interests of natural or legal 
persons in court proceedings; and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal 
claims; or where provided to government or public authority.  
The term UP/University/us refers to the Unive rsity of the Philippines System and 
Constituent University (CU) offices.  
The term you/your refers to all students of the University of the Philippines System, as 
well as those seeking to be admitted to the University (except for those seeking 
admission thr ough the UPCAT who are covered by the UP Privacy Notice for UPCAT 
applicants) and, where the context so indicates, in the case of minors, their parents or 
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  49 
 guardians who also sign registration related and other forms that students fill out, such 
as leave of  absence and scholarship application forms.  
PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM 
STUDENTS, AND THE PURPOSE/S AND LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING SUCH 
INFORMATION  
Various UP offices collect your personal information through paper based and online 
processing systems. UP may likewise collect publicly available information about you. 
Some application forms require you to provide a photograph. In some instances, your 
image is captured by UP's closed -circuit television (CCTV) cameras, or when UP 
documents, records, broadcasts (including live streaming), or publishes University 
activities or events.  
When you applied for admission to UP you provided us, through the forms you submitted 
and signed (and in the case of minors that your parents/guardians  also signed), among 
others, your name, sex assigned at birth, date and place of birth, civil status, citizenship, 
your photograph, information about your family (names of your parents, their citizenship, 
civil status ), your signature and other personal i nformation that we use, along with other 
documents you provide us (e.g. information contained in educational records) to be able 
to verify your identity in the course of determining your eligibility to enrol in UP. We 
required you to attest that the inform ation that you provided us is true and correct as we 
also use the information in order to prevent the commission of fraud. Such processing is 
necessary for compliance with our legal obligation as a publicly funded University and to 
uphold our legitimate in terest as an educational institution as well as that of taxpayers. 
When you provide UP with the personal and sensitive personal information of third 
parties you warrant that you have obtained their consent for UP to process their 
information.  
In the case o f students who were admitted through the UPCAT, you also provided the 
highest educational attainment and occupation of your parents as well as your family's 
annual household income. UP processed that information along with your permanent 
address and other information (e.g. grades) as the selection of campus qualifiers also 
considers socioeconomic and geographic factors as explained in the UPCAT Bulletin. 
Such processing is pursuant to Section 9 of RA 9500 which requires UP to take 
affirmative steps to enhan ce the access of disadvantaged students to the University's 
programs and services.  
Non-Filipino citizens seeking admission to the University are required to provide personal 
and sensitive personal information in order for UP to ascertain that their admissi on and 
enrolment is allowed under applicable Philippine laws, rules and regulations, and 
University rules and procedures.  
In order for UP to exercise its right to academic freedom and to uphold academic 
standards under its Charter it processes the educatio nal records and other personal 
information provided by prospective students to determine their eligibility to enrol.  
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  50 
 UP processes your personal and sensitive personal information, in the course of fulfilling 
its obligation, to provide you quality education  by exercising its right to academic 
freedom, and upholding academic standards, when the University's duly authorized 
personnel process your enrolment; evaluate the work that you submit in fulfilment of your 
academic requirements and give you grades; act o n your applications for change of 
matriculation, dropping, leave of absence and the like; determine your academic 
progress and compliance with the University's retention and other rules; evaluate and 
recommend you for graduation; act on appeals on such mat ters; and, in the event you 
are qualified under the rules, recommend that you be awarded honors upon your 
graduation.  
Aside from sensitive personal information in the form of grades, you also provide UP with 
health information as part of the admission and registration processes so that the 
University may determine your physical fitness to enrol; and be able to provide you with 
the proper care when you avail of UP's health services; or in case of an emergency; or 
in compliance with University rules that are meant to uphold academic standards (e.g., 
submission of medical certificates in order for your absences to be excused, for you to 
drop a subject, go on leave of absence, or justify underloading in an appeal to graduate 
with honors, etc.).  
UP processes info rmation regarding your religious affiliation in the course of verifying 
your identity (e.g. offices match information in your birth certificate and school records 
provided to us etc.) to conduct research to see to it that we uphold the principle of 
democra tic access; and that, as a non -sectarian institution, we do not discriminate on 
the basis of religious creed; and to uphold your right to freedom of religion(e.g. by 
providing you with services that are consistent with your beliefs in relation to your heal th 
needs and food preparation, etc.).  
The University may process your personal and sensitive personal information in order to 
compile statistics and conduct research, subject to the provisions of the DPA and 
applicable research ethics guidelines, in order to carry out its mandate as the National 
University.  
Contact information is processed by UP in order to be able to communicate effectively 
with you, and to enable us to contact your family or other people you identify, in the case 
of an emergency. For example, UP offices or your teachers may use the information 
generated by the applicable registration system in order to contact you via email or via a 
messaging system for class related and other academic matters, as well as UP related 
activities and information. UP may also contact you in order to solicit your consent to 
participate in academic or non -commercial research.  
In some instances, because UP is aware that not all students have access to the Internet 
at all times, or that you may  have failed to update email or contact details, UP may inform 
you of the need to contact certain UP offices, or to submit certain requirements by a 
certain date, or otherwise disseminate information that you need to know by posting your 
name or other rele vant personal information on UP bulletin boards. In the case of email 
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  51 
 correspondence, your email address may be disclosed to other members of the class so 
that other students to whom you may have disclosed your new email address, or other 
contact details, will be able to relay email messages to you.  
UP processes personal and sensitive personal information, and, in particular, financial 
information related to your studies, in order to administer State -funded and privately 
financed scholarships, as well as gr ants or other forms of assistance, pursuant to its 
contractual or legal obligations as part of the University's legitimate interests and that of 
taxpayers, as well as relevant third parties, such as donors or sponsors.  
Your personal and sensitive personal information may also be processed in order for UP 
to provide you with services, such as the issuance of your ID card, stickers or gate 
passes, library, dormitory, health, counseling and guidance services and the like; 
facilitate the processing of applicati ons for insurance and insurance claims; determine 
whether the student organization or association to which you belong may be recognized 
and given access to University services, etc., to enable your participation in student 
elections, exchange programs, int ernships, training programs, conferences, etc.; 
administer scholarships, grants and other forms of assistance, pursuant to UP's 
contractual or legal obligations; or to protect your vitally important interests.  
CCTVs and other security measures which may in volve the processing of your personal 
information are intended to protect your vitally important interests, for public order and 
safety, and pursuant to the University's and the public's legitimate interests. UP 
processes personal and sensitive personal in formation in order to comply with its duty 
as an academic institution to exercise due diligence to prevent harm or injury to you or 
others.  
You may also be required to present your UP ID when you avail of University services, 
or when you request documents containing your personal and sensitive personal 
information. If you request such information through a representative, UP will require that 
you provide a letter of authorization specifying the information or document requested, 
the purpose(s) for which the  same will be used, and the presentation of your UP ID or 
other valid government -issued identification card (GIID), as well the GIID of your duly 
authorized representative, in order for UP to see to it that fraud is prevented, and your 
right to data privac y is upheld.  
UP will process your name, student number and photograph in order to issue your UP 
radio -frequency enabled identification (RFID). A unique, randomly generated number, 
as well as your student number, will be encoded in the RFID tag or chip of y our UP ID 
such that these will be the only information that can be read by a compatible RFID reader.  
UP, using its RFID readers, will process the above mentioned information when you tap 
or wave your UP ID card in close proximity to such readers in order t o: 
• regulate access to libraries and other University buildings in order to supplement 
other existing security measures in place;  
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  52 
 • provide you with RFID enabled services in UP offices where these are applicable 
or available; and  
• provide benefits to qualified  students pursuant to the UP Charter and relevant 
internal rules.

required unde r its Charter to adopt measures in order to provide democratic access to 
its services. Rest assured that the University will process the above UP RFID information

What are my options if I think I have been or am being sexually harassed?   
Sexual harassment exists because of harassers. Do not give them the satisfaction 
of you being defeated. Take action against harassment and let SIDRA be your guide:   
Self-care. Consider Threat Modeling and reclaim your safety. Remember, it is not  your 
fault.   
Identify the abuse. Note the evolving language of this kind of violence especially 
online.   
Document. Note important details such as the date, time, location, witness, and the 
act(s) of sexual harassment.   
Report. If and when you are ready, report the sexual harasser to OASH by emailing 
oash.upcebu@up.edu or accomplishing the In -take Form.   
Assess the fight. Seek advice on available University Procedures and/or court action 
for the redress of your grievance.   
What if I want to remain a nonymous?   
OASH is ready to receive any complaint of sexual harassment affecting our UP Cebu 
Community, whether anonymously or not. However, for reported sexual harassment 
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  76 
 to be actionable by OASH according to available University Procedures, the UP ASH 
Code in section 16(a) specifically requires that the report should be   
●   done in writing  
●   signed by the person reporting/complaining of the incident (whose connection 
with UP Cebu and that of the person complained of need to be validated on 
jurisdiction al consideration), and  
●   notarized.   
In case of verbal report/complaint, OASH shall facilitate the documentation. In 
coordination with the Legal Office, OASH shall also facilitate the needed notarization.   
This does not mean that anonymous complaints will not be addressed. They will still 
be, only that the manner of addressing them will not be similar to what OASH is 
empowered to do if complaints comply with the strict requirements of the UP ASH 
Code.   
Remarks and Contact Information   
OASH i s currently exploring ways to have an enabling environment for the reporting of 
sexual harassment in UP Cebu beyond the strict provisions of the UP ASH Code. This 
includes addressing anonymous complaints to hold true to its zero tolerance of sexual 
harassm ent. You can help by sending your suggestions to oash.upcebu@up.edu.ph. 
Workable suggestions that are in accord with due process of law will be included in the 
policy recommendations of OASH in its annual report to the Chancellor.

7.4.   SCHOLARSHIPS AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE  
 
a. RA 10931 - Universal Access to Tertiary Education Act of 2017  
 Filipino Students who are either currently at the time of effectivity of the Free Tertiary 
 Education Act, or shall enroll anytime thereafter, in courses leading to a bachelor’s 
 degree in any SUC or LUC shall be exempted from paying tuition and other scho ol 
 fees for units enrolled in. Students will be eligible to receive these benefits provided 
 they qualify under the admission and retention requirements of UP Cebu.   
 
 The following students are ineligible to avail of free higher education:  
 
• Students who have already obtained a bachelor’s degree or comparable 
undergraduate degree from any public or private HEI  
• Students who fail to comply with the admission and retention policies of UP 
Cebu, resulting in the student’s permanent disqualification  from enrolling  
• Students who fail to complete their bachelor’s degree within a year after the 
period prescribed in their program.  
• Students who voluntarily opt out  
 In cases where students are ineligible for the RA 10931, they can still avail of free or  
 discounted tuition and other school fees, through Student Learning Assistance  
 System   (SLAS) Online.  
     
 
b. Student Learning Assistance System (SLAS)   Online  (slasonline.up.edu.ph)  
 
Students from the University of the Philippines (UP) come from all walks of life. Some of them 
may not be able to afford to pay the full tuition and other expenses to complete their academic 
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  81 
 requirements. As the UP community transitions to remote learning,  other forms of learning 
assistance are needed to respond to the changing times.  
 
To expand the support to financially -challenged students and expedite the processing of support 
for academic activities, the University developed the Student Learning Assista nce System (SLAS).

   7.5.   STUDENT ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS   
 
 7.5.a. Rules and Regulations governing student organization,     
 fraternities, and sororities  
 
1. Rationale  
 
The holistic development of the person is not realized only in terms of academics. Among other 
things, the development of one’s academic, emotional, cultural, physical, social and

person.   Opportunities for student leadership and involvement in student organizations and 
activities provide an avenue for the total person to develop outside the four walls of a classroom.  
  
While it is important that student organizations are afforded  greater autonomy in managing their 
affairs, it is but necessary to provide a structure which ensures that student organizations operate 
in a way that advances the holistic development and growth of their membership.

Introduction   
The Information Technology Center of the University of the Philippines Cebu shall ensure the 
safet y, security, and well -being of the constituents of the university's constituents, along with 
the maintenance and security of the campuses' information technology resources.  
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  122 
 Policy   
The Information Technology Center of the University of the Philippines is mandated to provide 
its services under the office's policy. Listed below are the different policies on the acceptable 
use of the various Information Technology resources of the University of the Philippines 
System.  
  
1. Policy Statement  
1. Computers and networks are powerful technologies for accessing and 
distributing information and knowledge. They are strategic technologies for the 
current and future needs of the UP SYSTEM.  
2. For now, computing facilities and network infrastructure are costly resou rces 
and thus must be used solely for teaching, learning, research, and other 
officially -sanctioned activities. Since these technologies allow individuals to 
access and copy information from remote sources, users must respect the 
rights of others, particul arly their privacy and intellectual property. There is, 
therefore, a need for rules and regulations to ensure equitable, secure, and 
reliable access to these resources. The following regulations will govern the 
use of computing facilities, networks, and ot her Information Technology (IT) 
resources of the University of the Philippines System.  
3. Furthermore, these regulations are established, we shall aim to:  
1. Ensure an information infrastructure that shall promote the basic 
missions of the UP System in teaching,  learning, and research;

of the IT resources of the UP System;  
3. Establish a process and system needed for addressing policy violations 
and providing sanctions for the violator s; 
4. Emphasize that the UP System shall not be liable for any damages that 
are incurred from the use of the IT resources and for any claims and 
suits arising from the unauthorized and irresponsible use of the same;  
5. Warn users that the use of IT resources for  partisan political activities 
as defined in the relevant rules and regulations of the civil service 
commission or the University of the Philippines or for any unauthorized 
commercial purposes is prohibited; and  
6. Notify users of the existence of such polici es established.  
 
2. Basic Standards  
1. The same standards and principles of intellectual and academic freedom 
developed for university libraries shall be applied to material received from the 
network. The same standards of intellectual and academic freedom devel oped 
for any faculty and student publication in traditional media shall be applied to 
publication in computer media.  
2. As constituents of the academic community, faculty, students, and academic 
and non -academic staff should be free, individually and collecti vely, to express 
  
UP Cebu Student Handbook  123 
 their views on issues of institutional policy and on matters of general interest to 
the academic body. The constituents of the academic community should have 
clearly defined means to participate in the formulation and application of 
institutional policy affecting academic and student affairs. The actions of the 
constituents of the academic community within the areas of its jurisdictions 
should be reviewed only through orderly prescribed procedures.
